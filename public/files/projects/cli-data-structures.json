Over the course of a year, a single studio or builder can produce dozens of maps and potentially hundreds of assets. Despite good organizational efforts, tracking these assets becomes increasingly difficult.",

The current process to import assets to the server is slow and inefficient, requiring builders to locate files, upload them to the FAWE schematics server, and manually copy and use returned commands."
