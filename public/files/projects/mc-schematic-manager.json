          "In the dynamic world of Minecraft map creation, both studios and individual builders face the significant challenge of managing a vast array of assets. Over the course of a year, a single studio or builder can produce dozens of maps and potentially hundreds of individual assets. Despite even the best organizational efforts, tracking these assets becomes increasingly difficult as the volume grows.",
          
          "Builders often struggle to maintain a clear inventory of their available assets, which can lead to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for asset reuse. This disorganization can result in wasted time searching for specific items, redundant creation of similar assets, and ultimately, delays in project timelines.",

          "Currently in order to have an asset imported to the server builders have to locate the file, upload it to FAWE schematics server via their website, copy the returned text that is then used as a command on the server in order to get the asset into their clipboard. This system is slow and inefficient."
